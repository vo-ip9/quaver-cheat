# quaver-cheat
are you so unapologetically awful at quaver that you need a script to do it for you? Well look no further,,,,,,,,
if you use this script to get on the leaderboards / while not offline, you will probably get banned, so best to not do that.

### To Install:
clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/vo-ip9/quaver-cheat
```
download required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
run the script
```
python main.py
```
